# Project 1
*ME30 Electromechanical Systems and Robotics I*

## Build a breadboard power supply with the following characteristics:
* It consists of a PCB that plugs directly into a breadboard
* It accepts power form  2.1 x 5.5 mm plug from a 12 V wall adapter
* It emits 12 V, 5 V, and 3.3 V (at the same time)

## My final design
