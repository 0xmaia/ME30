# Project 2
*ME30 Electromechanical Systems and Robotics II*

## Build an H-Bridge Motor Controller with the following characteristics:
* It consists of a PCB with screw terminals for power and control lines
* It also accepts power from a 2.1 x 5.5 mm plug from a 12 V wall adapter
* It has a power LED that lights up when motor power is available
* It can make a DC motor spin in both directions
* The motor current traces can handle 12 V and 5 A continuously without melting
* It can be controlled by logic signals form an Arduino

## My final design:
